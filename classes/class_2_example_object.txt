Object: Blue Moon

Attributes:
var alcoholContent = 4.5;
var sizeInOunces = 16;
var isBeerOnTap = true;

Methods:
makeItADouble (assuming that you're able to double the size of a beer, this will make sizeInOunces = 32, and rise the alcoholContent)
finishKeg (this will turn isBeerOnTap = false since it's all gone now)
addJuice (this will turn the colorOfDrink = 'Orange')
trySample (assuming that this will be done before the keg is finished, the attribute sizeInOunces = 2)
